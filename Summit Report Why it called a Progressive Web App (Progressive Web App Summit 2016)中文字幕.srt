2
00:00:02,685 --> 00:00:03,810
- ROB DODSON: 嗨  大家好
ROB DODSON: Hey, everybody.

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:03,910
怎么回事呢
What's up?

4
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:04,780
我是 Rob Dodson
It's Rob Dodson.

5
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,260
我们再一次来到 Progressive Web apps 峰会
We are here again at the Progressive Web Apps Summit.

6
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,072
我们现在在演讲者等候室
We are in the speaker ready room.

7
00:00:09,072 --> 00:00:11,530
这里是演讲者交换的地方
This is where folks are hanging out in between their talks.

8
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,905
我刚刚和 Alex Russell 在聊天
I'm joined right now with Alex Russell, who is a software

9
00:00:13,905 --> 00:00:15,090
他是 Chrome 团队的软件工程师
engineer on the Chrome team.

10
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,630
Alex 可以说是 progressive web apps 的鼻祖了
Alex is sort of like the progenitor of progressive web apps.

11
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,790
我这么说对吗
Did I use that word correctly?

12
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:20,080
- ALEX RUSSELL: 是的
ALEX RUSSELL: Yeah.

13
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:20,705
- ROB DODSON: 好 
ROB DODSON: OK.

14
00:00:20,705 --> 00:00:21,680
感觉不错
That felt good.

15
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,234
作为 progressive web apps 的
Sort of like a creator of some of the concepts

16
00:00:24,234 --> 00:00:25,400
一些相关概念的创造者
around progressive web apps.

17
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,816
我比较好奇  Alex 
And I'm curious, Alex, for someone

18
00:00:26,816 --> 00:00:29,325
对于一些不熟悉 progressive web apps 的人来说
who is new to the topic of progressive web apps,

19
00:00:29,325 --> 00:00:30,950
你是否可以和我们简单介绍下
can you tell us a little bit about what

20
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,120
这些概念意味着什么？
it means for something to be one of these things?

21
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,149
这是一个混合应用吗  还是其他什么
Is this like a hybrid app, or what is this exactly?

22
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:36,940
- ALEX RUSSELL: 好的
ALEX RUSSELL: Yeah.

23
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,300
这和混合应用不一样
So unlike hybrid apps, which you kind of package up and put

24
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,300
混合应用可能需要你打包  整合  发布到商店
in a bundle and then distribute through a store,

25
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,150
而 progressive web apps 仅仅是网站
progressive web apps are just websites.

26
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,620
如果你使用它们的次数足够多
Except if you use them enough and if they

27
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,550
以及它们满足特定的质量标准
meet specific quality criteria so that the browser knows

28
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,170
那么浏览器会觉得它运行良好 然后说下线
that it would work well, say offline, or had

29
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,720
或者已经获得良好的主页数据  
good metadata for your home screen, once it meets that bar,

30
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,010
一旦满足条件  浏览器开始把它看做一个应用
the browser can start to treat that more like an app,

31
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,067
同时  你可以开始选择拥有它 
and you can start to opt in to having it or keeping it

32
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:03,450
或者把它保存在主页  把它放到应用列表诸如此类。
to your home screen, putting it in your apps list, that sort of thing.

33
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,240
那么  如果我是一个商家
ROB DODSON: And so if I'm a business

34
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,562
我正在了解这个  对我来说有什么吸引人的使用场景呢
and I'm checking this out, what is the motivating use case

35
00:01:10,562 --> 00:01:12,020
好吧  比如说
for me to be like, all right, cool,

36
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,047
如何把我们当前的东西转换为这个模式呢
let's take our current thing and switch over to this model?

37
00:01:15,047 --> 00:01:18,500
这种模式有一堆的底层技术
ALEX RUSSELL: So the model has a bunch of underlying tech below it.

38
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,659
你需要得到 TLS ( Transport Layer Security )
So you need to get TLS.

39
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:20,950
你要有一个安全的网站
You have to have a secure site.

40
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,730
Service workers 会提供离线
Service workers are what enable offline and reliable

41
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,430
可靠的性能  消息推送
performance, and push notifications,

42
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,392
以及许多其他优秀的现代 web 东西
and a bunch of other really good modern web stuff.

43
00:01:28,392 --> 00:01:30,850
一旦你拥有了这些  并把它们整合起来
And once you have all of that, and you put it all together,

44
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,730
仅仅通过一条连接
you can deliver an experience to users

45
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,794
用户就可以得到和原生的应用相媲美的体验
just through a link that can rival native apps.

46
00:01:35,794 --> 00:01:37,710
最后  他们可以存在于主页
And eventually, they can be on the home screen

47
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,980
并重新参与  就像是一个原生的应用。
and be reengaging just like native apps.

48
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,455
这个真的有效
And it's really working.

49
00:01:41,455 --> 00:01:43,580
正在着手构建 progressive web apps 的人们
The folks who are starting to build progressive web

50
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,880
甚至没有支持 progressive web apps 的浏览器厂商
apps, even for browsers that don't support them,

51
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,880
他们都看到重大的前景
are seeing major gains.

52
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,860
像 Ali Express  一支相当强大的团队
Like Ali Express, really strong team.

53
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,360
他们似乎停止其他运作
They just sort of stopped the world,

54
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,610
把网站转为了 progressive web apps
and they turned their site into a progressive web app.

55
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,290
他们甚至在 iOS 中也看到很大的提升
And they saw a huge lift in engagement, even on iOS.

56
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,700
移动互联网体验领域的投资
So really investing in the mobile web experience

57
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,930
仍然在探索中
is what this is about.

58
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,480
但是  我们能让你
But we give you the ability to actually get

59
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,910
真的获得 Android 上的类应用体验
to app-like experiences on Android.

60
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,676
- ROB DODSON: 好吧  我被说服了
ROB DODSON: And so, OK, I'm sold.

61
00:02:10,676 --> 00:02:11,800
我开始想做这件事
I want to start doing this.

62
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,790
有哪些工具
What are some tools that I can use

63
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,800
我可以用来转换到这个模式吗
to start to transition over to this model?

64
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,810
这是很大的技术进步
ALEX RUSSELL: It's a big tech step.

65
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,930
但是  可以确认的是  对现在的人们来说  
But the hardest part so far for folks

66
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,610
最难的部分是你要满足参与的门槛
has been verifying that you meet that engagement bar,

67
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,515
门槛是指你的应用质量
that quality bar for your app.

68
00:02:26,515 --> 00:02:28,640
现在有一些工具能起到帮助
And there's a couple of tools that are helping now.

69
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,570
你可以在 Chrome Canary 测试版下
If you check out the new Applications

70
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,200
开发者工具里的新应用面板
Panel in Dev Tools in Canary in beta in Chrome,

71
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,900
找到一堆的支持帮助
you'll see that there's a bunch of support

72
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,266
在调试应用时
for getting all the information you need about your app

73
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:39,640
你便能得到所需要的全部信息
when you're doing live debugging.

74
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,130
同时  在 Google 的 github 下面
And also there's a project called

75
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,014
有个名为 Lighthouse 的项目
Lighthouse, which is in the Google Chrome organization on GitHub.

76
00:02:45,014 --> 00:02:46,680
这个项目很棒
And this is awesome because it gives you

77
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,444
它提供拓展和命令行的工具
an extension and a command line tool that you can verify

78
00:02:49,444 --> 00:02:52,360
它可以用来验证你是否满足所有的标准条件
that you've met all those criteria with, which is pretty awesome.

79
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,370
这帮我省下了大量的时间
Saved me tons of time.

80
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,694
推荐一下
Recommended.

81
00:02:54,694 --> 00:02:55,650
- ROB DODSON: 好了
ROB DODSON: Right on.

82
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,250
我们会在节目笔记中
So we will include links to all the tools

83
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,220
包含 Alex 推荐的所有工具的链接
that Alex mentioned down in the show notes.

84
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,530
在 YouTube 的 Chrome 开发者频道
We've also got links to Alex's talk

85
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,500
我们也会提供  Alex 演讲的链接
on the Chrome Developers YouTube channel down there as well.

86
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,000
Alex  在晴朗的 Amsterdam 非常感谢你和我们在一起
Alex, thank you so much for being with us today in sunny Amsterdam.

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,190
我是来自 PWA (Progressive Web App) 峰会的 Rob Dodson
I'm Rob Dodson from the PWA Summit.

88
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,280
我们下次见
I'll see you around.
